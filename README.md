# Energy-Visualization
This was a Visualization contest (optional) in my ECE 2720 Class where I was chosen as the winning visualization.
In addition to the data found in this repository, population data from 	https://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/table/by-year was also utilized. This visualization showed several interesting trends aside from the obvious increase in energy consumption per individual.

One trend details the complete lack of renewable energy in the transportation sector which leads one to question it 
due to the electric vehicle market. This trend however does make sense since the electricity generated for these vehicles
mostly comes from fossil fuels, making its impact on the visual miniscule and invisible to the eye. 

Out of all of the sectors, the industry as a whole uses more renewable energy than either the residential or commercial sector which makes somewhat sense
given the lack of consumer options for homeowners and the overall smaller commercial energy consumption. 

The largest relative increase in energy consumption is in the residential sector which is logical since the amount of electricity
and power needed to maintain our copious amounts of electric devices and lighting and more vastly outweigh that of any minimal
energy consumption of the 1950s. 

One last final trend worth noting is that in 2017, the average person consumes 5 times as much energy as a person in 1949,
not to mention the actual population increase in the US since then has been tremendous, making the total amount of energy
generated and consumed in the US very large, contributing to the rapidly increasing rate of climate change.
